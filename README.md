Steps to Run the Updated Prototype
Save the files: Save each of the above code snippets into separate files named Booking.java, Flight.java, BookingService.java, and BookingApp.java.

Compile the files: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files. Compile them using:

sh
javac Booking.java Flight.java BookingService.java BookingApp.java


sh

java BookingApp


The updated application should now correctly handle flightId as a String and allow searching for flights, selecting a flight, and saving bookings in a console application. The user can enter flight details, save bookings, search for flights based on departure and arrival locations, and view all available flights.
